# Ready-to-go kata bootstrap projects

This repository contains starter projects for running katas in a variety of languages. All projects are using the latest language and framework versions (thanks to [renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/)) and run on any device straight out of the box using Visual Studio Code and [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). 


<b>In the cloud:</b> Select the language from below and click "Open in GitHub Codespace" or "Open in GitPod"

<b>In VisualStudio Code:</b> Select the language from below and click "Open in VisualStudio Code"

## Contributing a bootstrap

The general paradigm of this repository is to create self-contained, minimal starter projects that are least likely to (silently) break in the future and can automatically be kept up-to-date.

Any bootstrap project may be added to this repository, if:

- The language is not yet present **or** the test-framework enables a different paradigm than the bootstraps already present for the language (e.g. a cucumber or mutation testing tool, not just junit4 or testng)
- Dependencies and docker images are well-known and commonly used
    - Avoids using custom Dockerfile-based dev-containers (they will have to be built each time a devcontainer starts)
    - Uses only one testing framework and one assertion library
- One failing, and one succeeding test exists
- Version numbers are fixed (so they can be picked up and updated by renovate)

A bootstrap needs to contain a valid [`.devcontainer.json`](./java/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) that configures a container with all appropriate tooling. See any of the existing bootstrap projects for reference.
